Failover Routing

It work on Primary and second server 
help if primary server goes down we can work with secondry server 

Work on Health Check 


Lab

Step to follow 

Need 2 servers 
Intall httpd/apache 
Create Simple record in Route53
Create Health Check 
Create Failover record and associate health check 




Step 1. Create 2 EC2 Servers - Redhat

Step 2. Install apache 
#Install apache on both the server 

#Login to Redhat server 1 

sudo yum install httpd -y 
sudo service httpd start
sudo nano /var/www/html/index.html   - server1

#Repeat above steps for server 2 

sudo yum install httpd -y 
sudo service httpd start
sudo nano /var/www/html/index.html   - server2


Step 3. Create Simple record in Route53 

Step for server 1 

Create simple record 
Go to route53 - select the hosted zone - create record

in record name - server1.vickydevops.tk 
in record type - A record
value - enter the IP address of first server
TTL - 
Routing policy - simple 

Repeat the same steps for server 2

Go to route53 - select the hosted zone - create record

Create simple record 
In record name - server2.vickydevops.tk 
in record type - A record
value - enter the IP address of second server
TTL - 
Routing policy - simple 


Step 4. Create Health Check 

3 types of health check 

1. endpoint - simple as returing 200 message if the website is running or not 
2. calculated health check  - look for other health check and than do some calculation 
3. cloudwatch alarm - trigger cloudwatch 


Go to Route53 - Select Healthcheck 

Name - server1
What to monitor -  Enpoint 
In Monitor an endpoint - 

Specify endpoint by - IP 
Protocol - HTTP 
IP address - mention server Public IP here of server1
Host name - server1.vickydevops.tk
Port * - 80 
Path - leave 
Create alarm - No 
Create health check 


Repeat same step for server2

Name - server2
What to monitor -  Enpoint 
In Monitor an endpoint - 

Specify endpoint by - IP 
Protocol - HTTP 
IP address - mention server Public IP here of server1
Host name - server2.vickydevops.tk
Port * - 80 
Path - leave 
Create alarm - No 
Create health check 


Wait for the healthcheck status to turn to green 


Step 5 Create Failover record and associate health check 

Create failover record 

In record name - failover.vickydevops.tk 
in record type - A record
value - enter the IP address of first server
TTL - 
Routing policy - failover 
Failover record type - primary 
Health check ID - select server1 healthcheck 
Record ID - 1

Create another record 

In record name - failover.vickydevops.tk 
in record type - A record
value - enter the IP address of second server
TTL - 
Routing policy - failover 
Failover record type - secondry 
Health check ID - select server2 healthcheck 
Record ID - 2


To verify - shutdown server1 - now with healthcheck configure it will route traffic to server2 automatically
