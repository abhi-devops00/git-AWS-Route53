Step to follow 

Need 2 servers in differnt AVZ or Region
Intall httpd/apache 
Grab the public IP of both servers
Create Health Check 
Create Weighted record and associate health check 


Step-1
Need 2 servers in differnt AVZ or Region

Create 1 EC2 Servers in N.V - Redhat
Create 2 EC2 Servers in Mumbai - Redhat


Step 2. Intall httpd/apache 
#Install apache on both the server 

#Login to Redhat server 1 

sudo yum install httpd -y 
sudo service httpd start
sudo nano /var/www/html/index.html   - server1

Login to Redhat Server 2 

sudo yum install httpd -y 
sudo service httpd start
sudo nano /var/www/html/index.html   - server1


Step 3. Grab the public IP of both servers

Step 4. Create Health Check  ( optional )

3 types of health check 

1. endpoint - simple as returing 200 message if the website is running or not 
2. calculated health check  - look for other health check and than do some calculation 
3. cloudwatch alarm - trigger cloudwatch 


Go to Route53 - Select Healthcheck 

Name - server1
What to monitor -  Enpoint 
In Monitor an endpoint - 

Specify endpoint by - IP 
Protocol - HTTP 
IP address - mention server Public IP here of server1
Host name - server1.vickydevops.tk
Port * - 80 
Path - leave 
Create alarm - No 
Create health check  


Repeat same step for server2

Name - server2
What to monitor -  Enpoint 
In Monitor an endpoint - 

Specify endpoint by - IP 
Protocol - HTTP 
IP address - mention server Public IP here of server1
Host name - server2.vickydevops.tk
Port * - 80 
Path - leave 
Create alarm - No 
Create health check 


Wait for the healthcheck status to turn to green 


Step 5. Create Weighted record and associate health check

Go to Route53 - select the hosted zone - Create Record
In Routing policy - select Weighted
Reduce the TTL - TTL (seconds) for eg. 30 
Record type - A
Record name - weight
Alias or Value
Alias - Alias to another record in this hosted zone 
value - IP of server1
Health check ID - server1  (optional)
Record ID - server1 


Repeate the steps for server2

Go to Route53 - select the hosted zone - Create Record
In Routing policy - select Weighted
Reduce the TTL - TTL (seconds) for eg. 30 
Record type - A
Record name - weight
Alias or Value
Alias - Alias to another record in this hosted zone 
value - IP of server2
Health check ID - server2  (optional)
Record ID - server2
